# ERC-721 Token Standard

ERC-721 is a non-fungible token (NFT) standard on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike ERC-20 tokens which are fungible (interchangeable), each ERC-721 token is unique and has distinct properties.

## Key Features:
- Each token has a unique ID
- Non-interchangeable
- Can represent ownership of digital or physical assets
- Supports metadata for additional properties

## Use Cases:
1. Digital Art & Collectibles
   - Unique artwork
   - Trading cards
   - Virtual items in games

2. Real Estate
   - Property ownership
   - Land titles
   - Virtual real estate

3. Gaming
   - In-game items
   - Characters
   - Special abilities

4. Identity & Certification
   - Digital credentials
   - Certificates
   - Licenses

5. Supply Chain
   - Product authenticity
   - Tracking unique items
   - Ownership history

The main advantage of ERC-721 is its ability to represent unique digital assets with verifiable ownership on the blockchain, making it perfect for applications requiring distinct, non-interchangeable tokens.


## IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

IPFS is a distributed file system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data in a blockchain environment. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

### Key Concepts:
- Decentralized Storage: Files are split and stored across multiple nodes instead of a single server
- Content Addressing: Files are identified by their content (hash) rather than location
- Immutability: Once stored, content cannot be modified without changing its hash
- Peer-to-Peer: Users can retrieve files from the nearest available node

### Integration with Blockchain:
1. NFT Metadata Storage
   - Store image/media files
   - Maintain token properties
   - Reduce on-chain storage costs

2. Benefits
   - Permanent and verifiable storage
   - Reduced bandwidth usage
   - Enhanced data availability
   - Censorship resistance

IPFS complements blockchain technology by providing an efficient, decentralized way to store and distribute large files while maintaining the security and immutability that blockchain offers.

# Base64 in Smart Contracts

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme commonly used in blockchain and NFT development:

1. Key Benefits
- Safely encodes binary data into ASCII string format
- Useful for encoding NFT metadata directly on-chain
- Helps with data transmission between smart contracts and front-ends

2. Common Uses in NFTs
- Encoding image data directly in smart contracts
- Creating on-chain SVG NFTs
- Storing metadata URIs in a standardized format

3. Character Set:
Uses 64 different characters:
A-Z (26 characters)
a-z (26 characters)
0-9 (10 characters)
'+' and '/' (2 characters)
'=' for padding
4. How it works:
Takes 3 bytes (24 bits) of binary data
Divides it into 4 groups of 6 bits each
Each 6-bit group is represented by one character from the Base64 alphabet
If the input length isn't divisible by 3, padding ('=') is added
Common Uses:
Embedding images in HTML/CSS
Encoding email attachments
Storing binary data in JSON
Data URIs in web browsers
Encoding authentication credentials
5. Advantages:
Platform independent
Preserves data integrity during transmission
Widely supported across programming languages
Safe for use in URLs and filenames
6. Disadvantages:
Increases data size by approximately 33%
Not encryption (just encoding)
Slightly slower processing compared to binary
Base64 is particularly relevant in web development, especially when dealing with data URIs, image embedding, and API authentication tokens.3
